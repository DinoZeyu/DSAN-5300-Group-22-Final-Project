## Introduction 

Airbnb has transformed travel by offering unique accommodations that provide a local experience, different from traditional hotels. In Thailand, with its rich culture and picturesque landscapes, Airbnb has seen a surge in popularity. This project focuses on examining Airbnb in Thailand, particularly its popularity and distribution.

We will analyze the location, pricing, ratings, and availability of Airbnb properties across Thailand to determine their level of popularity. By examining these factors, we aim to identify trends and patterns that explain why certain Airbnb listings are more favored by travelers. This analysis will help us understand the dynamics of Airbnb's market in Thailand and provide insights into the preferences of guests.
